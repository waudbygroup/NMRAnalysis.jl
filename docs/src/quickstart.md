# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with NMRAnalysis.jl, even if you're new to Julia.

## Installation

1. If you don't already have Julia installed, **download Julia** from [https://julialang.org/install/](https://julialang.org/install/) and install according to the instructions on this page.

2. **Verify installation** by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```
   julia
   ```
   You should see the Julia REPL (interactive prompt) with version information.

3. Once Julia is installed, you need to **add the NMRAnalysis package**:

   1. Enter package mode by pressing `]` (you'll see the prompt change to `pkg>`)
   2. Add the package by typing:
      ```
      add NMRAnalysis
      ```
   3. Wait for installation - Julia will automatically download and install NMRAnalysis and all its        dependencies
   4. Exit package mode by pressing Backspace

4. **Activate the installation** by typing:
   ```julia
   using NMRAnalysis
   ```

   You should see an information message listing the available analysis routines.

!!! note "Package Installation"
    The first time you install NMRAnalysis, it may take several minutes to download and compile all dependencies. This is normal and only happens once.

## Basic Usage

1. **Navigate to your data directory**:
   ```julia
   cd("/path/to/your/nmr/data")  # Replace with your actual data path
   ```
   For example: `cd("/Users/chris/NMR/my_experiment")`

2. **Load the package**:
   ```julia
   using NMRAnalysis
   ```

3. **Get help** on any function:
   ```julia
   ?diffusion    # Shows help for diffusion analysis
   ?r1rho        # Shows help for R1ρ analysis
   ```

Some examples of analysing **1D experiments**:

```julia
using NMRAnalysis

# Diffusion analysis - analyzes DOSY experiments
diffusion("106")  # Analyze experiment in folder "106"

# TRACT analysis - for rotational correlation times
tract()           # Prompt to select experiment folders

# R1ρ relaxation dispersion
r1rho()                                   # Show file selection dialog
r1rho(["11", "12"])                       # Analyze experiments 11 and 12
r1rho(["11", "12"], minvSL=500)           # Filter low spin-lock strengths
```

**2D experiments** can be analysed with the interactive graphical interface:

```julia
# Relaxation analysis (T1, T2)
relaxation2d(
    "expno",            # Processed spectra as pseudo-3d
    [0.01, 0.03, 0.05]  # Relaxation delays (s)
)

# Heteronuclear NOE analysis
hetnoe2d(
    ["reference/pdata/1", "saturated/pdata/1"],  # Reference and saturated spectra
    [false, true]                                # Saturation states
)
```

### File formats

NMRAnalysis works with standard Bruker data formats:

```julia
# Single experiment (TopSpin experiment number)
diffusion("106")

# Multiple experiments
r1rho(["11", "12", "13"])

# Processed data directories
hetnoe2d(["reference/pdata/1", "saturated/pdata/1"], [false, true])

# Full paths (if data is elsewhere)
diffusion("/Users/chris/NMR/project_data/106")
```
